# Ethical-Hacking
This repository has project reports from my ethical hacking practice on the Infosec Lab platform. Each report explains a specific lab, its goals, the steps I followed, the tools I used, and what I learned. Below is a brief overview of Infosec Lab and a summary of each report.
Lab 1: Performing Reconnaissance from the WAN In this lab, the main objective was to practice external network reconnaissance techniques by scanning a network protected by a pfSense firewall. The tasks involved identifying open ports, detecting operating systems and services, retrieving hashed passwords from the target system, and ultimately gaining administrator access to a Windows Server using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

To achieve these objectives, I used several tools and techniques throughout the lab. The primary tools included Kali Linux 2 Attack Machine for launching attacks, Nmap for comprehensive port scanning and service detection, Netcat for interacting with open ports, and Telnet to test services running on specific ports. Additionally, I utilized Linux commands to retrieve the /etc/shadow file containing password hashes and used Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to establish remote access to the Windows Server after successfully cracking the credentials.

The lab steps included performing Nmap scans across various ports such as 21, 23, 25, 80, 110, 443, 1099, 3306, 3389, 5432, and 8180 to identify active services. Based on the scanning results, I gathered valuable information about the exposed services and operating systems running behind the firewall. After retrieving the /etc/shadow file, I worked on cracking the password hashes to extract credentials. Using the obtained administrator credentials, I successfully established an RDP session with the target Windows Server.

Overall, the lab was successful in demonstrating multiple reconnaissance techniques and post-exploitation steps. I was able to effectively scan and identify vulnerable services, retrieve sensitive files, and gain administrative access. However, there were some challenges such as cracking complex password hashes, maintaining a stable RDP connection, and avoiding detection during scans. The lab also highlighted several risks like the use of insecure services (e.g., Telnet), exposure of sensitive password hashes, and weak internal protections that could leave a network vulnerable to exploitation. As part of the recommendations, I suggest disabling insecure services, enforcing stronger firewall rules, regularly updating systems, implementing multi-factor authentication, and continuously monitoring the network for unauthorized activities.
Lab 2: Scanning the Network on the LAN Objective: The objective of this lab was to understand the different stages of penetration testing by exploiting a vulnerable Postgres service running on a Linux server. This included the phases of planning, scanning with tools like Nmap and Zenmap, performing vulnerability assessments with OpenVAS and Greenbone Security Assistant, and finally gaining access using the Metasploit framework for remote and local privilege escalation. Tools Used:For this lab, I used Kali Linux as my attack platform. Network scanning was conducted using Nmap and Zenmap. Vulnerability assessments were performed using OpenVAS and Greenbone Security Assistant. IceWeasel was used as the browser interface to access OpenVAS. For exploitation and privilege escalation, I used the Metasploit framework, specifically targeting the vulnerable Postgres service and leveraging local udev exploits to gain root access on the Linux server.
Conclusion:
The lab successfully demonstrated the process of exploiting a vulnerable Postgres service to gain privileged access to a Linux server. Nmap, Zenmap, OpenVAS, and Metasploit effectively identified and exploited system weaknesses. The primary risk involved was the unpatched Postgres service, which allowed unauthorized access and full control of the system through privilege escalation. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to regularly update services, enforce strong authentication, configure firewalls properly, and perform regular vulnerability assessments. The challenges encountered included understanding Postgres configurations, integrating multiple tools, and managing complex privilege escalation tasks, but these were overcome through careful planning and execution.
Lab 3 Enumerating Hosts Using Wireshark, Windows, and Linux Commands Objective: The objective of this lab was to configure a sniffer to capture live network traffic and analyze it using Wireshark to gain a deeper understanding of the protocols and traffic patterns operating within the network.
Tools Used: In this lab, I used Wireshark as the primary tool to capture and analyze network traffic. Traffic was generated using multiple protocols, including FTP, Telnet, and Mail, which were initiated from a Windows machine. Additional configurations were performed on Kali Linux to set up the network interface for capturing packets in promiscuous mode, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conclusion: Throughout the lab, Wireshark successfully captured and analyzed network traffic across various protocols, revealing how sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and email content can be exposed when using unencrypted protocols like FTP and Telnet. The main risks observed were the ease of intercepting unencrypted data, which could lead to information theft and unauthorized access. To mitigate these risks, I recommend switching to encrypted alternatives like SFTP and SSH and ensuring proper network monitoring to maintain security. Some initial challenges included correctly configuring the network interface for capturing traffic and managing the large volume of captured data, but once resolved, meaningful traffic analysis was successfully performed.
Lab 4: Remote and Local Exploitation Objective:This lab focused on exploiting a vulnerable PostgreSQL service on a Linux server to simulate a penetration testing engagement. The goal was to identify open ports, assess vulnerabilities, gain initial access, and escalate privileges using the Metasploit Framework. Key successes included bypassing authentication and achieving root access through privilege escalation.Tools Used: Nmap and Zenmap were used for network scanning to detect open ports, while OpenVAS and the Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) helped identify vulnerabilities in the PostgreSQL service. The Metasploit Framework automated exploitation, leveraging modules like postgres_login for credential brute-forcing and udev_netlink for privilege escalation. IceWeasel, a lightweight browser, facilitated interactions with web-based tools.
Key Takeaways
Unsecured default credentials and misconfigured services (e.g., PostgreSQL) allowed unauthorized access. Defensive measures like patch management, strong passwords, and restricting service permissions could mitigate such risks. The lab also highlighted the importance of monitoring for suspicious network scans, as tools like Nmap can trigger security alerts.
Lab 5: Crafting and Deploying Malware Using a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) Objective: This lab simulated a cyberattack chain: scanning for vulnerabilities, brute-forcing credentials, and deploying a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) for persistent control. The attack leveraged weak RDP credentials and disguised malware to exfiltrate sensitive data from a compromised host.Tools Used :Nmap identified open RDP (3389/tcp) ports, and Bruter cracked the administratorâ€™s password via a dictionary attack. DarkComet RAT created a malicious payload, obfuscated with UPX (Ultimate Packer for Executables), which was then uploaded via Microsoft Remote Desktop (mstsc). The RAT enabled file theft, keylogging, and backdoor persistence.
Key Takeaways
Weak passwords and unsecured RDP access were critical vulnerabilities. Defensive strategies include enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA), network segmentation, and endpoint detection tools to block RAT signatures. User education on phishing and suspicious downloads is equally vital.
Lab 6: Capturing and Analyzing Network Traffic Using a Sniffer Objective: This lab demonstrated passive network reconnaissance using Wireshark to capture and analyze plaintext protocols (FTP, Telnet, SMTP). The goal was to identify exposed credentials and insecure traffic patterns.Tools Used: Wireshark captured live traffic, while FTP and Telnet generated unencrypted data for analysis. Opera Mail illustrated email protocol vulnerabilities. Command-line tools like ifconfig configured promiscuous mode for comprehensive packet capture.
Key Takeaways
Unencrypted protocols (e.g., FTP/Telnet) expose credentials and data to sniffing attacks. Recommendations include adopting SSH, SFTP, and TLS-enabled email protocols. Network monitoring tools (e.g., IDS/IPS) can detect abnormal traffic patterns, such as excessive ARP requests or plaintext logins.
Lab 8: Performing a Denial of Service Attack from the WAN Objective: This lab simulated TCP, UDP, and HTTP flood attacks using the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) to overwhelm a target system. The goal was to analyze traffic patterns with tcpdump and capinfos, measure resource exhaustion, and understand the impact of DoS attacks on service availability.
Tools Used
LOIC: Generated high-volume traffic floods (TCP/UDP/HTTP).
tcpdump: Captured packets on the eth0 interface for analysis.
capinfos: Quantified attack impact (e.g., 110 TCP packets in 465 seconds).
Nmap: Verified open ports pre/post-attack.
Key Takeaways: DoS attacks rapidly saturated bandwidth, with TCP floods consuming connections and HTTP floods disrupting web services. Defenses like rate limiting and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are critical to mitigate such attacks. Challenges included managing traffic volume and interpreting packet capture data.
Lab 9: Using Browser Exploitation to Take Over a Host's Computer Objective: Exploited the MS08-078 vulnerability in Internet Explorer via a spear-phishing email. Gained Meterpreter access, dumped password hashes with hashdump, cracked credentials using John the Ripper, and defaced a website to demonstrate impact.
Tools Used
Metasploit: Deployed the ms08_078_xml_corruption exploit.
Meterpreter: Extracted hashes, took screenshots, and pivoted internally.
John the Ripper: Cracked Administrator hashes (e.g., P@ssw0rd).
Phishing Simulation: Sent malicious links via fake emails.
Key Takeaways: Outdated browsers and weak passwords (e.g., default credentials) allowed full system compromise. Recommendations include patch management, user training, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Lab 10: Attacking Webservers from the WAN Objective: Compromised a web server by brute-forcing SMTP credentials with Bruter, accessed the system via RDP, defaced the website, and cleared logs to cover tracks.
Tools Used
Bruter: Cracked Administrator:P@ssw0rd via SMTP.
RDP (mstsc): Uploaded malicious files and modified index.html.
Apache Log Manipulation: Deleted entries to evade detection.
Key Takeaways: Exposed SMTP services and weak passwords facilitated unauthorized access. Mitigations include firewall rules, log integrity monitoring, and disabling unnecessary services.
Lab 11: Exploiting a Vulnerable Web Application Objective: Exploited XAMPP WebDAV default credentials (xampp:xampp) to upload a backdoor, pivoted to an internal Windows server via SMB (MS09-050), and dumped hashes with Armitage.
Tools Used
Nmap/Zenmap: Identified WebDAV (port 80) and SMB (port 445).
Metasploit: Used xampp_webdav_upload.php and ms09_050_smb2 exploits.
Armitage: Automated pivoting and hash dumping.
Key Takeaways: Default credentials and unpatched SMB vulnerabilities allowed lateral movement. Network segmentation and regular patching are essential to limit breach scope.
Lab 15: Performing SQL Injection to Manipulate Tables in a Database **Objective:** This lab focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in a MySQL database system through SQL injection techniques. The primary goal was to demonstrate how weak database security configurations could lead to complete system compromise. I began by identifying exposed MySQL services, then progressed to brute-forcing credentials using common password lists. After successfully gaining access with default root credentials (blank password), I created a persistent backdoor account named "hacker" with password "mypass123" to maintain access. The exploitation culminated in accessing and extracting sensitive information from database tables, including credit card records from the owasp10 database, illustrating the severe consequences of database vulnerabilities. Tools Used: Nmap identified MySQL running on port 3306. Metasploitâ€™s mysql_login module brute-forced credentials, while the MySQL CLI allowed direct database manipulationâ€”including accessing the owasp10.credit_cards table.
Key Takeaways: Unsecured databases with weak credentials pose severe risks. Key defenses include using parameterized queries to block SQL injection, conducting regular permission audits, and encrypting sensitive data to limit exposure if breached.
